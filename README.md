[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/luinardi/hypermapper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/luinardi/hypermapper)

## Software and Installation
We recommend installing HyperMapper with `pip`:
```
pip install hypermapper
```

Please see the wiki for the [quick start guide](https://github.com/luinardi/hypermapper/wiki) and [alternative installation](https://github.com/luinardi/hypermapper_dev/wiki/Install-HyperMapper).

## Abstract
HyperMapper is a multi-objective black-box optimization tool based on Bayesian Optimization. 

HyperMapper was succesfully applied to real-world problems involving design search spaces with trillions of possible design choices. In particular it was applied to: 
1) Computer vision and robotics,
2) Programming language compilers and hardware design, 
3) Database management systems (DBMS) parameters configuration.

To learn about the core principles of HyperMapper refer to the papers section at the bottom.
